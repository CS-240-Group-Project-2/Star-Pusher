Instructions:

Star-Pusher is a puzzle game played on a grid of varying size. 

The goal of the game is to move the player character, one tile at a time, and push all of the star sprites on the current level onto the designated star tiles. 
//mention difficulty if we decide on varying difficulties


The tiles you will encounter while playing Star-Pusher are as follows:

Wall Tile:

Wall blocks serve as barricades that neither players nor boxes can pass through.


Floor Tile: 

Floor tiles are navigable by the player, and boxes can be pushed onto these tiles. 


Star Sprite:

Star sprites are movable by the player. They can be pushed from all four sides onto the surrouding floor tiles. Each star sprite on a level must rest on a designated star tile to pass that level. 


Star Tile:

Star Tiles are the designated resting points for star sprites. Move all Star Sprites onto Star Tiles in order to pass a level.
