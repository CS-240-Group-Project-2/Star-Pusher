Instructions:

Star-Pusher is a puzzle game played on a grid of varying size. 

The goal of the game is to move the player character, one tile at a time, and push all of the star sprites on the current level onto the designated star tiles. 

Parts of the screen:

The score tracker is on the right, beneath the display of the current level. The score tracker shows how many moves the player has taken so far on the current level.

On the left is the game section of the window, where the player navigates their sprite through the tiles to try to get the stars to their designated spots.

The tiles and entities you will encounter while playing Star-Pusher are as follows:

Wall Tile:

Wall blocks serve as barricades that neither players nor boxes can pass through.


Floor Tile: 

Floor tiles are navigable by the player, and boxes can be pushed onto these tiles. 


Star Sprite:

Star sprites are movable by the player. They can be pushed from all four sides onto the surrouding floor tiles. Each star sprite on a level must rest on a designated star tile to pass that level. 


Star Tile:

Star Tiles are the designated resting points for star sprites. Move all Star Sprites onto Star Tiles in order to pass a level.

Player:

The player character's sprite. Navigate this little guy around the map to get the star sprites onto the star tiles.
